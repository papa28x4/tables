1) Robust Search that searches every entry in the table(not just names)

2) Table Pagination

3) Print to PDF

4) Print to CSV

5) Sorting(ascending and descending)

6) Print

7) More details sidebar that's hidden at certain screen sizes(<860px) and scrolls from right to left when any of the table rows is clicked
